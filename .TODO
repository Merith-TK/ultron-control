[X] improve turtle backend by exposing command API through open http post method and websocket
	data is raw lua as string,
		`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  --data-binary '["return skyrtle.turnLeft()"]' http://localhost:3300/api/v1/turtle/1`

[ ] Initialize skyrtle pos on turtles
	* could use GPS if present
	* require user intervention

[ ] make worldData accept arbitrary positioning for blocks, HTTP POST ONLY, websocket can be used for reading
	```lua
	-- example of what lua data should look like before serializeJson
	local worldPost = {
		[ pos.x .. "," .. pos.y .. "," .. pos.z ] {
			block = data.name,
			data = {},
		}
	}
	```

[ ] Add Documentation method to Modules
